                                From <b>September 15th through October 15th, 2023</b>, an interactive public installation will be 
                                presented near the Cut, a sub-street level, open-air green space that runs parallel to Callowhill Street 
                                from North Broad Street to 18th Street. The project is installed along the 18th Street pedestrian bridge 
                                that traverses the Cut. Asian Arts Initiative (AAI), in collaboration with eo Studio and 2022 Artists-in-Residence 
                                Dr. Ashley Gripper (of Land Based Jawns) and Sonia Galiber (of Soil Generation), present an immersive mixed 
                                reality project called <b>Invasive Species: Eco/Systems Land Based Initiatives</b>. The project invites visitors to use 
                                mixed reality as they cross-pollinate the Cut’s diverse plant life with narratives about cultural and physical migration. 
                                Throughout the project, eo Studio, Gripper, and Galiber engage community members to collect personal narratives 
                                and migration stories. The project includes an <b>interactive multimedia performance</b> on <b>October 7th and 8th</b> along 
                                the 18th Street Bridge. Details in the Programs page; admission is free and open to all.

                        <p>This exhibit explores the Cut as a complex and nurturing habitat; in conjunction, it scrutinizes the term “invasive species,” offering insight into the way we see flora, fauna, and each other, as well as what we don’t see. Around the globe, plants, like people, have always found ways to migrate, explore, and adapt. And yet, the term “invasive species” is often used when referring to plants and bugs that are not native to a land; especially as they begin to have a noticeable or disruptive presence within the ecosystem. While the impact of that presence may be worth noting, what often goes undertold is the story of human interference that causes plant migration and abrupt changes to ecosystems. Without this piece of the narrative, the plant or bug itself becomes stigmatized as unwelcome and disruptive. The political implications of using the language “invasive species” becomes all the more problematic when considering the parallel to migration and displacement of people.</p>
                        <p>AAI envisions how artists can innovate interventions to create awareness of the environment and stories we carry, supplementing the work of local institutions and circumventing historic challenges via creative, transformative strategies. As a racially identified organization, AAI seeks to engage artists who represent the global and city majority in a community-led process that will directly impact our Chinatown/Callowhill North neighbors and neighborhood as a whole. In a city and arts field recovering from a devastating year amid myriad pandemics, we intend to support artists from marginalized communities who can most speak to the benefits and challenges posed by urban greenspace renewal, climate disaster, and migration.</p>

                                <i>Invasive Species: Eco/Systems Land Based Initiatives</i> is a project of Asian Arts Initiative. Concept by Ashley Gripper and Sonia Galiber. Public Art by eo Studio.</p>
                        <p>
                                <i>Invasive Species: Eco/Systems Land Based Initiatives</i> is funded by the Our Town Grant of the National Endowment for the Arts and the William Penn Foundation. Our Town projects advance local economic, physical, or social outcomes in communities, ultimately laying the groundwork for systems change and centering equity. These projects require a partnership between a nonprofit organization and a local government entity, with one of the partners being a cultural organization. Asian Arts Initiative is pleased to partner with SEPTA and the City of Philadelphia to present Eco/Systems: Land Based Initiatives in 2023.</p>
