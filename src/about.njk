                        <p>From <b>September 15th through October 15th, 2023</b>, an interactive public installation is coming near the Cut. The Cut is a sub-street level, open-air green space that runs parallel to Callowhill Street from North Broad Street to 18th Street. The project is installed along the 18th Street pedestrian bridge that traverses the Cut. eo Studio, in collaboration with Asian Arts Initiative and 2022 Artists-in-Residence Dr. Ashley Gripper (of Land Based Jawns) and Sonia Galiber (of Soil Generation), present an immersive mixed reality project called Invasive Species: Eco/Systems Land Based Initiatives. The project invites visitors to use mixed reality as they cross-pollinate the Cut’s diverse plant life with narratives about cultural and physical migration. Throughout the project, eo Studio, Gripper, and Galiber engage community members to collect personal narratives and migration stories. The project includes an interactive multimedia performance on October 7th and 8th along the 18th Street Bridge. Details in the Programs page; admission is free and open to all.</p>
                        <p>This exhibit explores the Cut as a complex and nurturing habitat; in conjunction, it scrutinizes the term “invasive species,” offering insight into the way we see flora, fauna, and each other, as well as what we don’t see. Around the globe, plants, like people, have always found ways to migrate, explore, and adapt. And yet, the term “invasive species” is often used when referring to plants and bugs that are not native to a land; especially as they begin to have a noticeable or disruptive presence within the ecosystem. While the impact of that presence may be worth noting, what often goes undertold is the story of human interference that causes plant migration and abrupt changes to ecosystems. Without this piece of the narrative, the plant or bug itself becomes stigmatized as unwelcome and disruptive. The political implications of using the language “invasive species” becomes all the more problematic when considering the parallel to migration and displacement of people.</p>
                        <p>On the heels of the latest release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, AAI envisions how artists can innovate interventions to climate disaster, supplementing the work of local institutions and circumventing historic challenges via creative, innovative strategies. As a racially identified organization, AAI seeks to engage artists who represent the global and city majority in a community-led process that will directly impact our Chinatown/Callowhill North neighbors and neighborhood as a whole. In a city and arts field recovering from a devastating year amid myriad pandemics, we intend to support artists from marginalized communities who can most speak to the benefits and challenges posed by urban greenspace renewal, climate disaster, and migration.</p>
                        <p>Invasive Species is a project of Eco/Systems Land Based Initiatives, funded by the Our Town Grant of the National Endowment for the Arts and the William Penn Foundation. Our Town projects advance local economic, physical, or social outcomes in communities, ultimately laying the groundwork for systems change and centering equity. These projects require a partnership between a nonprofit organization and a local government entity, with one of the partners being a cultural organization. Asian Arts Initiative is pleased to partner with SEPTA and the City of Philadelphia to present Eco/Systems: Land Based Initiatives in 2023.</p>

Since 2010, her primary focus has been on her ongoing project Impermanence—which serves as both her life practice and visual body of work. Impermanence, as a practice, is an ongoing reflection and confrontation with the passage of time. An exercise of letting go and learning to use time as an agent of change, by creating deliberate & consistent patterns to achieve desired results. As a body of work, Impermanence embodies these ideas through the use of visual patterns & the creation of worlds that reflect the inner universe of memory, thought & mind.  While also examining the origins of thought, belief and the perception of reality, through the use of dreamlike imagery and augmented worlds. These ideas in conjunction with Scott’s interest in futurism/technology and its relationship with humanity, form the foundation of her work.
“If nothing else, I hope that my work opens up more minds to the true collective nature of reality. That the lives we live and the world we experience, are a mirror reflection of the patterns of our inner dialogue & thoughts.   When you change your thoughts, you change your behaviors & actions and when you change your actions you change yourself, when you change yourself, you change your community & humanity in turn.”
